## Project Overview
This project analyzes Sephora skincare data to identify high-margin opportunities in a saturated market. By leveraging Python (Pandas) and natural language processing, we identified that **"Eye Creams"** offer the highest ROI, while terms like **"Gel"** negatively impact pricing power.

## Key Insights
* **The Opportunity:** Luxury eye creams ($125+) show inelastic demand (higher ratings at higher prices).
* **The Gap:** Competitors rely heavily on texture modifiers rather than active ingredients.
* **The Strategy:** Launch a "Firming Repair Complex" avoiding the term "Gel".

## Technical Tools
* **Language:** Python 3.9
* **Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, adjustText, NLTK (Tokenizer)
* **Data Source:** [Link to Kaggle Dataset]
