## Project Overview
This project analyses Sephora skincare data to identify high-margin opportunities in a saturated market. By leveraging Python and SQL, I identified **"Eye Creams"** offer the highest ROI, while terms like **"Gel"** negatively impact pricing power.

## Key Insights
* **The Opportunity:** Luxury eye creams ($100-130) show an opportunity gap - no product sits in this range.
* **The Gap:** Competitors rely heavily on texture modifiers rather than active ingredients.
* **The Strategy:** Launch a "Firming Repair Complex", avoiding the term "Gel".

## Technical Tools
* **Language:** [Colab](./Sephora_Products.ipynb), [SQL](./Project_New_launch.sql)
* **Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy, adjustText
